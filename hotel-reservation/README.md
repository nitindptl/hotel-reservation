Hotel reservation system using spring boot and thymeleaf.

This project implements a complex domain model powering a session based wizard form flow to book
a hotel room. The flow simulates a real world application in terms of having a variety
of booking options and business rules. 

Key features include

- Thymeleaf ajax fragments + javascript
- Google maps API integration
- Responsive CSS with semantic-ui
- Extensive spring mvc tests + mockito
- Hibernate
- Query DSL


# Getting started

This is the standard spring boot entry point, you can run this from within intellij if you dont want to run the created jar generated by mvn.

To play around in the IDE, run `mvn clean compile` to generate any QueryDsl auto generated classes.
